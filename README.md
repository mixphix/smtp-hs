# smtp-hs

A self-contained library for working with MIME and sending emails in Haskell.

This is very much a work in progress! It's an effort to unify the various mail libraries throughout the Haskell ecosystem into one that captures the entire scope of the RFCs on the Internet Message Format. It's by no means stable or suitable for production.
